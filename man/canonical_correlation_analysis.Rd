\title{Canonical correlation analysis}
\usage{
canonical_correlation_analysis(x, y, epsilon = 1e-04, inplace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix of size n-by-p with n observations from p variables. Alternatively, data
frames and numeric vectors are supported and automatically converted.}

\item{y}{Matrix of size n-by-p with n observations from p variables. Alternatively, data
frames and numeric vectors are supported and automatically converted.}

\item{epsilon}{Numeric value usued as tolerance threshold for rank reduction of the
input matrices. Default is \code{1e-4}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components
\itemize{
  \item{xcoef}{Estimated estimated coefficients for the \code{x} variable.}
  \item{ycoef}{Estimated estimated coefficients for the \code{y} variable.}
  \item{cor}{Matrix with correlation coefficients.}
}
}
\description{
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) finds pairs of vectors \eqn{(w,v)} such that projections
\eqn{Xw} and \eqn{Yv} have maximal possible correlations. The pairs are ordered in decreasing
order of the correlations. In addition, projection vectors are normalized such that the
variance of \eqn{Xw} and of \eqn{Yv} is equal to \eqn{1}. This means that projections are
not only correlated, but "on the same scale" and hence can be directly compared.
